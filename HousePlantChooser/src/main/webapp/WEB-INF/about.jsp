<h4>About</h4>
<p>
Plant Parenthood helps users determine which plants will thrive in any given location.
 To do this, the app leverages a custom device that reads and records the intensity
 of light in the location where it is placed. 
 As an example, the user can name the device after the location where it is placed, 
 such as "living room". 
 The user can then log into the app and select the location "living room". 
 They will then be directed to a page that displays the category of light in the room, 
 e.g. "low", "bright, indirect", or "bright direct", 
 along with a list of the plants that will thrive there.
