# JPAHousePlantChooser
## Description
### The HousePlantChooser app, which I have since tentatively renamed "Plant Parenthood", helps users determine which plants will thrive in any given location. To do this, the app leverages a custom device that reads and records the intensity of light in the location where it is placed. As an example, the user can name the device after the location where it is placed, such as "living room". The user can then log into the app and select the location "living room". They will then be directed to a page that displays the category of light in the room, e.g. "low", "bright, indirect", or "bright direct", along with a list of the plants that will thrive there.

## Lessons Learned
- I learned that HTTP requests operate very similarly across languages, making it relatively simple for a program in one language to submit a request to a program written in another.
- I learned the power of having a central database accessible via the Internet by any application with proper authorization. With this project, I got a glimpse of the interest and functionality afforded by the Internet of Things.
- I saw that cool things happen when you follow your creativity and bring together different aspects of a problem, such as hardware and software or data and analysis.
